I have a Ph.D. in Sociology and Methodology of Social Research and I am currently a post-doctoral researcher and research associate at the University of Luxembourg at the [Department of Humanities and Social Sciences](https://humanities.uni.lu/social-sciences).

I am interested in the institutional and informal constraints that prevent equal educational opportunities for all. I approach this broad topic from different angles: the dynamics of inequalities in a comparative perspective, the organizational features of schools that mitigate or exacerbate inequalities, and the links between digitalization and inequalities of educational opportunities. My technical skills range from building and handling large datasets to managing complex data and implementing innovative statistical analyses. I am an experienced user of Stata, with a solid understanding of R and Python programming (e.g., Pandas, Numpy, BeautifulSoup).

At the University of Luxembourg, I work as a member of the Centre for Childhood and Youth Research (CCY) to study the impact of digitalization on young people's life chances. Please visit our website at this [link](https://www.jugend-in-luxemburg.lu).

Before moving to the University of Luxembourg, I completed a Post-doctoral fellowship at the [University of Trento](https://www.sociologia.unitn.it/en), where I am a member of the [Trento Center for Social Research Methods](https://trentosocialresearchmethods.org/#:~:text=Trento%20Center%20for%20Social%20Research%20Methods&text=The%20Trento%20Center%20for%20Social,at%20the%20University%20of%20Trento.), the [Center for Social Inequality Studies](https://r.unitn.it/en/soc/csis), and the [Inequalitrees Project](https://inequalitrees.eu) (as Research Advisor).

I have presented at several international conferences and seminars (e.g., RC28 and ECSR), and my work has been published in the journals [Research in Social Stratification and Mobility](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562422000038?casa_token=lPXdjtO7d2cAAAAA:CCrM3h22Z4aH9npuVlncjMv047TmcWI0rY4Bb2nj_llaIHunVs6LfCEPh7sjA3YcDCTgDHY), [Socio-economic Planning Science](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003801211930240X?casa_token=bqWqFMdBLE4AAAAA:DfvryitKiT4bgCwmv3QazBkx35KPiwXUE4xinBIomLwwqD94CFctGgM-Z-7O1_eUBodSADk), and [Scuola Democratica- Learning for Democracy](https://www.rivisteweb.it/doi/10.12828/103251).
