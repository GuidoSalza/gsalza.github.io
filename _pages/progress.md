### A novel examination of trends in vertical and horizontal inequalities in higher education: A large scale cross-national analysis - with Moris Triventi (University of Trento)

Recent decades have seen a general expansion in participation in formal education, and more recently, there has been a growth in tertiary education enrollment in all economically developed countries. This trend has allowed students from lower social backgrounds to access higher education more than in the past, leading to a moderate decline in vertical inequality in higher education attainment. This paper aims to propose an innovative test of two classic theses in the social stratification literature on long-term trends in social inequality in educational attainment: the maximum maintained inequality (MMI) hypothesis and the effectively maintained inequality (EMI) thesis. For this purpose, we constructed a new cross-national dataset that combines data from several surveys (Adult Education Survey, European Social Survey, General Social Survey and Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies). The analytical sample size is around 140000 cases, including 40 countries and birth cohorts 1950-1986. In the first stage, the paper measures the level of vertical and horizontal inequalities for each country-cohort through an application (innovative for this field of study) of the Mutual Information Index. In a second stage, it estimates how the level of inequality is affected by some theoretically identified macro factors. This work has the potential to contribute to the exploration of long-term variations in social inequalities in education, the interaction between vertical and horizontal educational inequalities, and the application of quantitative methods to investigate these phenomena. The work has already been presented at international conferences to gather initial feedback.

### Specific Learning Disorders and Distance Learning - with Alice Scavarda (University of Turin)

Covid19 triggered a sudden shift from face-to-face to online classes in virtually all universities. The paper analyzes ad hoc data collected shortly after the Italy pandemic outbreak. The questionnaire investigates the weaknesses and potentials of distance learning delivered during the first wave of the pandemic and targets the population of students with specific learning disorders (SLDs) enrolled at the University of Turin, one of the leading institutions in northern Italy. Distance learning brings about both benefits and costs for students with SLDs. On the one hand, they benefit from the accessibility and availability of learning materials. On the other, distance learning jeopardizes these benefits by damaging the relational dimension with classmates and teachers. We are working on finalizing the paper.

### Educational inequalities & voting patterns - with Matteo Cavallaro (University of Lousanne)

There is a vast literature on voting patterns as a product of social stratification. Educational attainment is crucial and a good predictor of electoral choice. By bringing together various rounds of the European Social Survey and integrating the database with information on political supply, we ask how education inequalities link to voting choices from a longitudinal and comparative perspective; and how the level of stratification of different educational systems interacts with the relationship between educational qualification and electoral choice.
