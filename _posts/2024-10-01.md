Educational Inequality and Migration: A Complex Reality
======
Sociologists have long debated whether education serves as a tool for social mobility or reinforces social inequality. On one side, schooling provides individuals with skills and knowledge necessary for participation in modern societies. On the other, it can perpetuate social inequalities, favoring those from privileged backgrounds.
A significant part of this debate focuses on equality of opportunity and how socioeconomic status (SES) impact academic success. Children from higher SES families tend to perform better academically and pursue more ambitious educational paths, such as enrolling in universities or attending academically-oriented high schools. However, migration background also plays a key role in shaping educational outcomes, with many immigrant children facing additional challenges in education

The Migrant Gap in Educational Performance
------
Empirical research shows that, on average, students with a migration background perform worse academically than their non-migrant peers. They are more likely to repeat grades and drop out of school. While these trends can be partly explained by socioeconomic disadvantages, other factors, such as age at migration and limited proficiency in the language of instruction, further exacerbate the gap. Language barriers are especially significant, as students who do not speak the school’s language at home enter with lower proficiency, making it harder to succeed academically.
Moreover, migrant parents often struggle with unfamiliarity with the educational system in their new country. This can limit their ability to effectively support their children in school-related decisions. Social networks that provide key information to non-migrant families are often less accessible to immigrant families, further contributing to disparities.

Aspirations vs. Achievements
------
A recurring question in the literature is whether migrant students have higher educational aspirations than their non-migrant peers. The concept of immigrant optimism suggests that migrant families may have high aspirations for their children’s success, hoping for upward mobility. However, there is often a gap between these aspirations and actual educational attainment, as reflected in higher dropout rates. While some scholars argue that migrant students are trapped in an “aspirational paradox,” evidence remains inconclusive on this point.
The Role of Schools and Teachers
Schools can play a crucial role in reducing the educational gap for migrant students. Teachers generally support equity and cultural diversity, but many report feeling underprepared to work effectively with diverse student populations. Although explicit discrimination is rare, research highlights how teacher evaluations can sometimes be biased, with migrant students receiving lower grades or recommendations based on non-academic factors.

Institutional Influences
----
National policies, migration laws, and housing policies all shape educational opportunities for migrant students. For example, legal status can determine access to education, while housing policies can reinforce residential segregation, leading to schools with higher concentrations of migrant students.
Additionally, the structure of educational systems plays a crucial role in either exacerbating or reducing inequalities. Highly tracked systems, which divide students into academic paths early on, often reinforce existing disparities. In contrast, systems that provide more flexibility and choice may better support the integration of migrant students.
In conclusion, the educational gap for migrant students is influenced by a complex web of social, institutional, and individual factors, making it a challenging but essential issue to address in education policy.
